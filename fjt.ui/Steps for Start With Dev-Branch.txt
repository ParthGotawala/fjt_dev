Step 1 - Take latest of project and execute db changes.
Step 2 - Take latest "FJT-Dev" Branch in your local system from "Source Control Explorer" and map it into local.
Step 3 - "npm install" in both "UI" and "API" Project of new branch.
Step 4 - "bower install" in "UI" Project of new branch.
Step 5 - Copy "socket.io.js" file from "API/node_modules/socket.io-client/dist" and Paste it into "UI/bower_components/angular-socket.io/".
Step 6 - Take backup of your db and upload db with another name "flexjobtracking_dev".
Step 7 - Create New VirtualHost for Development Branch "PricingService_Dev" and "FJTEmailService_Dev". (http://localhost:15672/#/users)
Step 8 - Create new db collection in mongodb with name "fjtpricing_dev".
Step 9 - API Project "config.js".
 - Change "database" name from "flexjobtracking" to "flexjobtracking_dev".
 - Change "virtualhost" name from "PricingService" to "PricingService_Dev".
 - Change "virtualhost" name from "FJTEmailService" to "FJTEmailService_Dev".
Step 10 - API Project "mongodb.js".
 - Change db name from "fjtpricing" to "fjtpricing_dev".
Step 11 - Pricing Service "App.config".
 - Change connectionString Database from "flexjobtracking" to "flexjobtracking_dev".
 - Change key "MongoDBName" Key name from "fjtpricing" to "fjtpricing_dev".
 - Change key "RabbitMqPricingVirtualHost" from "PricingService" to "PricingService_Dev".
Step 12 - Email Service "App.config".
 - Change VirtualHost key name from "FJTEmailService" to "FJTEmailService_Dev".
Step 13 - Run Both Project and test once.
[Please don't follow, below is just for exceptional case when we have to run both project simultaneously]
Step 14 - To Run Both Main Branch and Dev Branch Project Simultaneously please follow below steps.
	- Run UI Project first and check port of same ( in my case UI Project "3002" when both main branch ui project is running)
	- In API Project 
		- "app_config.js" file change "PORT" from "2003" to "2004".
		- "config.js" file change "WebsiteBaseUrl" from "http://localhost:3000" to "http://localhost:3002".
	- In UI Project "config.js" file change  
		- "APIProjectURL" from "http://localhost:2003" to "http://localhost:2004".
		- "WebsiteBaseUrl" from "http://localhost:3000" to "http://localhost:3002/".
	- In Pricing Service "App.config" File
		- "FJTAPIUrl" from "http://localhost:2003/api/v1/" to "http://localhost:2004/api/v1/".
